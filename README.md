# RestAPI_CovidPredictor

Project Description:

Restful API Application to predict likelihood (percentage) of getting severe COVID-19 symptoms based on Patient Characteristics.

– Age,

– Gender,

– Ethnicity and

– Underlying Medical Conditions

Framework: Python Django

Database: SQLite3

ML/Statistical Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy

This Covid-19 symptom backend will be used by the web development and mobile development team within my Software Engineering class. This application contains a trained model that will help predict all the severe symptoms based on various factors above. I fully implemented both of these within a short period of time.
